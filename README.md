# My Receipts

Nowadays, we buy more and more material goods, which in the event of a failure are covered by the warranty. However, it often happens that when something stops working, it turns out that we can’t find the receipt and therefore report the failure. That’s why I decided to create an application in which we can store all our receipts.


## Features

* Show your receipts
* Sort your receipts
* Add new receipt with image
* Take photo for new receipt
* Save image to device gallery
* User notifications about the end of the warranty
* Create new categories for receipts

## Technology I used:

* SwiftUI
* XCode
* AVFundation
* CoreData (CloudKit)
* MVVM Architecture
* UserNotifications
* Figma (to design)
